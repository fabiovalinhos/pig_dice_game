GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if one of the dices will get value 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game, or you have possibility to change this limit (100 points) fullying another value in the field "final score"
